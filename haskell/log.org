[19:39] <zincy> Is there any way of seeing the derivation of typeclasses?

[19:42] <zincy> As in what do you traceShow to see the instance code?
[19:42] <dmj`> zincy: this is also core to how servant works as well. servant and GHC.Generics are actually the same thing in spirit
[19:42] <dmj`> zincy: so an extremely powerful technique is to use a closed type family which lets you explicitly recurse over a type like this
[19:43] <geekosaur> zincy, do you want -ddump-deriv?
[19:43] <dmj`> I've done this before to accumulate up all the field names in a record into a [Symbol], from here you can make a typeclass that converts [Symbol] -> [String]

[20:04] <hopsing> djm`: Is there s some reading you can recomment that I can get more insights in that direction?
[20:04] <dmj`> zincy: yea, I use them heavily in prod. code w/ Generics for working with databases
[20:04] <dmj`> correct by construction m'boi
[20:05] <zincy> dmj`: So it doesn't lead to code which is harder to maintain?
[20:05] <dmj`> hopsing: anything by kosmikus is the best literature out there on generics, hands donw

[20:05] <zincy> Am i right in saying typefamilies need to be used with data kinds to be useful?

[20:05] <merijn> zincy: Whether it's harder to maintain or not depends on how you use them
[20:06] <dmj`> hopsing: https://www.andres-loeh.de/ExploringGH.pdf
[20:06] <zincy> merijn: That kinda answers it, there are an infinite number of ways of defining ok
[20:06] <dmj`> zincy: not necessarily, but there's a 99% change you'll be turning on data kinds
[20:06] <dmj`> chance*
[20:06] == butterthebuddha [~butterthe@35.1.246.48] has joined #haskell
[20:07] <zincy> So data kinds promotes the data constructors to type constructors
[20:07] <dmj`> zincy: and also enables type level nats / symbols
[20:07] <dmj`> which Generics depends on
[20:07] <zincy> what are symbols in this context?
[20:07] <dmj`> type level strings
[20:08] <dmj`> http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.12.0.0/docs/GHC-TypeLits.html
[20:08] <zincy> Does data kinds turn types into kinds?
[20:09] <dmj`> zincy: yes
[20:09] <zincy> Then you have more expressive kinds to group types?
[20:09] == conal [~conal@209.209.238.168] has joined #haskell
[20:09] <zincy> So types of types are kinds

[20:09] <dmj`> and types of kinds are sorts
[20:10] <zincy> So we need kinds to group our types

[20:10] <Solonarv> dmj`: no, they're also types
[20:10] * dmj` falls out of chair
[20:10] <Solonarv> kinds, types, and sorts are all collapsed into the same layer in GHC
[20:10] <dmj`> that's with TypeInType
[20:10] <dmj`> which isn't enabled by default afaik
[20:10] <Solonarv> that's always on in reality
[20:10] <Solonarv> all the extension controls is whether you're allowed to write code using that
[20:11] <dmj`> maybe I live in a different reality then
[20:11] <Solonarv> % :set -XNoTypeInType
[20:11] <yahb> Solonarv:

[20:13] <dmj`> not on 8.6.3 :/
[20:13] <zincy> Yeah I think we forgot to answer his question
[20:13] <zincy> or hers
[20:13] <geekosaur> er, inverted. StarIsType is the old behavior, default is now NoStarIsType
[20:13] <Solonarv> the GHC manual says this about TypeInType: "In the past this extension used to enable advanced type-level programming techniques."
[20:13] <talqu> can i map/loop over all record fields somehow?
[20:14] <dmj`> talqu: using a closed type family over the meta data GHC Generics provides you, yes you can
[20:14] <[exa]> talqu: if they are of the same type, there might be lenses that do that
[20:14] <Solonarv> geekosaur: StarIsType is still the default for now
[20:14] <zincy> hopsing: haskell from first principles or learn you a haskell are good resources
[20:14] <geekosaur> oh, guess they put it off

[20:14] <Solonarv> the switch was only added in 8.6.1
