         Pico Lisp Installation
         ======================

There is no 'configure' procedure, but the Pico Lisp file structure is simple
enough to get along without it (we hope). It should compile and run on any Linux
system without problems.

By default, Pico Lisp installs completely in a local directory. No need to touch
any system locations, so you don't have to be root.


Please follow these steps:

1. Upack the distribution

   $ tar xfz picoLisp-*.tgz

2. Change the directory

   $ cd picoLisp-*.tgz

3. Compile the Pico Lisp interpreter

   $ (cd src; make)


         Invocation
         ==========

The shell script 'p' is usually called to start up Pico Lisp, typically with
'dbg.l' to load the interactive debugging environment.

$ ./p dbg.l
:

The colon ':' is Pico's prompt. You may enter some Lisp expression,

: (+ 1 2 3)
-> 6

To exit the interpreter, you may enter

: (bye)

or simply type an empy line (Return).


         Documentation
         =============

For further information, please read the Pico Lisp Reference Manual in
'doc/ref.html', the Pico Lisp tutorial in 'doc/tut.html', and the frequently
asked questions in 'doc/faq.html'.

As always, the most accurate and complete documentation is the source code ;-)
Included in the distribution are many utilities and pet projects, including
stress tests, a chat server, 2D drawing, a family database, minesweeper game,
tax accounting, genetic algorithm, GUI demos, 3D animation, and more.

Any feedback is welcome!
Hope you enjoy :-)
